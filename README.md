# ComfyUI-Fast-Style-Transfer
ComfyUI node for fast neural style transfer
This is a simple conversion based on this:
https://github.com/rrmina/fast-neural-style-pytorch

Only basic inference functionality is ported for now.

If you wanna use custom styles, then fork the original repo and use train.py script, then transfer .pth model file into "ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Fast-Style-Transfer/models" folder
