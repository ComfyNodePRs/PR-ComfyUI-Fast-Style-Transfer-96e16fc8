# ComfyUI-Fast-Style-Transfer
ComfyUI node for fast neural style transfer.

This is a simple conversion based on this:
https://github.com/rrmina/fast-neural-style-pytorch

Only basic inference functionality is ported for now.

If you wanna use custom styles, then clone the original repo and use train.py script, then transfer .pth model file into "ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Fast-Style-Transfer/models" folder

# Installation

Probably the usual. Just "git clone https://github.com/zeroxoxo/ComfyUI-Fast-Style-Transfer.git" into your custom_nodes folder. That should be it.

If it doesn't work then idk, ask stack exchange or something, how should I know what's wrong with your setup?
